## Markdown

Markdown (.md) files like this one have become the way to document code projects. It is a lightweight markup language that is written in a text editor (like VS Code) and viewed in a markdown reader (like VS Code).
To view a markdown document in VS Code, right click the document in the project tree or in the open editors and select "Open Preview".

### More on Git commit messages

**Do**

- do keep the message short (less than 60-ish characters)
- do explain what the commit does (not how or why!)

**Do not**

- do not explain why the changes are made (more on this below)
- do not explain how the changes are made (that's what git log -p is for!)
- do not use the word "and"  
   if you have to use "and", your commit message is probably doing too many changes - break the changes into separate commits
  e.g. "make the background color pink and increase the size of the sidebar"

```
__proto__ is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. prototype is the object that is used to build __proto__ when you create an object with new:

( new Foo ).__proto__ === Foo.prototype;
( new Foo ).prototype === undefined;
```

> Middleware and decorators are similar and can do the same job. They provide a means of inserting intermediary effects either before or after other effects downstream in the chain/stack.
>
> A difference is that the middleware pipeline is computed using a reduction that presents the middleware with a simpler interface that hides the next middleware object in the chain. Rather it presents a next function that applies the message to that object using the correct interface (e.g. IHandler.handle).
>
> Another difference is that it is easier to dynamically add/remove middleware because it exists in the middle of a container object (e.g. in an array) and the pipeline can be assembled on demand. A decorator is a stack of Russian dolls and its stack cannot so easily be rejiggered.
