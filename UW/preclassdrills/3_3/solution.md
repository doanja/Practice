Self-closing tags are tags that don't require a closing tag. Examples include br, hr, img tags. Self-closing tags do not require a closing / inside the tag but it can be preferable to add it, as some frameworks require it." "Self-closing tags are used for what are called void elements like horizontal rules and line breaks. These are called void elements because they inherently cannot have content. There is no way to add text to a line break, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. Similarly, you can't add text to a horizontal rule, so there is no need for an opening and closing set of tags. In general, any tag that can't hold text can be self-closing.
