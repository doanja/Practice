# 13_2 Solution

* Prototypes are central to Object Oriented JavaScript.
* JavaScript implements inheritance (an Object Oriented Programming principle) through Prototypes
* Prototypes hold properties and methods that _all_ objects of that type can access.
* For example, the Array prototype has the `push`, `map`, `any`,  `filter`, and `includes` methods. That's why every array can use those methods.
* The prototype can be thought of as a centralized storage place for functionality that all objects of a type share access to.
